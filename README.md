# CS205-Warm-Up-Project
Avocado parsing program: 
This program accesses a database holding avacado price and sale information based on region and time.
The user does not need to know query syntax. The parser program converts the user's search into query language, 
searches the database, and return the relevant information.

The program to run is AvocadoWarmUp.py
This interacts with the two csv files avocado-region-data and avocado-sales-data.
The rest of the files were used to build up to the final product/test the final product.
